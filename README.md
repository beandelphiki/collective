This is a todo list app for programmers.


Can't remember how or when you solved a programming problem or any other problem for that matter? This iPad only app will organize  and show how you solved problems in the past. (At least problems that you document). 

Sometimes we look all over for problems we have solved already, but sometimes we solved that same problem a long time ago.
I hope this app helps! 
I will be adding updates to it as well.
